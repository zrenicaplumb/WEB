                    <p>The Mayor's House was built in the 1980s by Tom Stocks,
                    the former Mayor of Moab, and his wife, Gay. The interior
                    of the B&B has a warm family appeal and is comfortably
                    furnished in the Southwestern style with locally handcrafted
                    furniture.</p>

                    <p>The 16-foot long Western-style breakfast table seats 16, allowing
                    guests to mingle and become friends with people from all over the
                    country and the world. Guest rooms are individually decorated to
                    reflect the many cultures of the Southwest.</p>
