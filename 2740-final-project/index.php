                    <h2>Our Location</h2>
                    <img src="img/location.jpg">
                    <p>The Mayor's House is perfectly situated in a quiet
                    neighborhood overlooking the town of Moab,
                    just 4 1/2 blocks from downtown-area shopping, restaurants,
                    museums and art galleries. The view of the world-famous
                    Slickrock Bike Trail makes the perfect background for a relaxing
                    afternoon by the pool. </p>

                    <h2>Access To Local Attractions</h2>
                    <img src="img/town.jpg">
                    <p>The B&B is within a few minutes walk from Moab's central
                    business district, but well away from the noise and congestion
                    of downtown. The B&B is also situated close to the Slickrock Bike
                    Trail, 10 minutes from the entrance to Arches National Park,
