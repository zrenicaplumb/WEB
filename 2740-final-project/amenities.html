                    <h2>Our Location</h2>
                    <img src="img/location.jpg">
                    <p>The Mayor's House is perfectly situated in a quiet
                    neighborhood overlooking the town of Moab,
                    just 4 1/2 blocks from downtown-area shopping, restaurants,
                    museums and art galleries. The view of the world-famous
                    Slickrock Bike Trail makes the perfect background for a relaxing
                    afternoon by the pool. </p>

                    <h2>Access To Local Attractions</h2>
                    <img src="img/town.jpg">
                    <p>The B&B is within a few minutes walk from Moab's central
                    business district, but well away from the noise and congestion
                    of downtown. The B&B is also situated close to the Slickrock Bike
                    Trail, 10 minutes from the entrance to Arches National Park,
                    and 30 minutes from the entrance to Canyonlands National Park.
                    Many bike trails, hiking trails, and jeep trails are all
                    within a short distance of the B&B. </p>

                    <h2>Bring Your Toys</h2>
                    <img src="img/toys.jpg">
                    <p>We invite you to make use of our ample off-street parking, which can accommodate virtually all types of vehicles and trailers. A locked bike storage shed is also available.</p>

                    <h2>Directions</h2>
                    <p>Moab is approximately 4½ hours from Salt Lake City, Utah, and six hours from Denver, Colorado.</p>
