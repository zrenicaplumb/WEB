        <h3>Persian</h3>
        <img src="mobileSupport/images/cat1">
        <p>Named after its country of origin, what is now called Iran, the Persian's striking eyes and flat, curious face are distinct features. Known for having a calm and friendly demeanor, Persians are a good choice for apartment living or families, and do best when kept exclusively indoors. The cat's coat needs a considerable amount of grooming to prevent mats; frequent baths are also recommended. </p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h3>Exotic Shorthair Cat</h3>
        <img src="mobileSupport/images/cat2">
        <p>Like the look of a Persian cat, but don't want the hassle of caring for its long fur coat? The Exotic Shorthair has similar features as the Persian, with a coat that is short and dense, giving it a cute, teddy bear look. The breed is also similar to the Persian in temperament. Exotics are easy-going and usually get along quite well with other pets and humans. It's an affectionate cat that enjoys sitting in laps. </p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h3>Maine Coon</h3>
        <img src="mobileSupport/images/cat3">
        <p>A true American, the longhaired Maine Coon cat is one of the the oldest breeds to originate in the United States and is the official state cat of Maine. However, its exact origin is one shrouded in mystery. Known for its excellent hunting skills, the Maine Coon was bred as a working cat that could survive rough winters in the Northeastern U.S. Despite having rugged abilities, Maine Coons are friendly and great with children. Unlike most other cat breeds, Maine Coons have a fondness for water.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h3>Ragdoll</h3>
        <img src="mobileSupport/images/cat4">
        <p>The most striking features on a Ragdoll is the cat's bright blue eyes. The breed was developed to be a companion animal and its name comes from its tendency to go limp — like a rag doll—when picked up. Ragdolls also like to be around their humans and will follow them from room to room. It's a large and sturdy breed developed in the 1960s by Ann Baker of Riverside, California.</p>

				<h1>Labrador Retriever</h1>

				<h2>Labrador Retriever</h2>
				<img src="mobileSupport/images/dog1">
				<p>The Labrador Retriever, also Labrador, is a type of retriever-gun dog. The Labrador is one of the most popular breeds of dog in the United Kingdom and the United States.

				A favourite disability assistance breed in many countries, Labradors are frequently trained to aid the blind, those who have autism, to act as a therapy dog and perform screening and detection work for law enforcement and other official agencies. They are prized as sporting and hunting dogs.

				A few kennels breeding their ancestors, the St. John's water dog, were in England. At the same time, a combination of the sheep protection policy in Newfoundland and rabies quarantine in the United Kingdom, led to their gradual demise of the St. John's water dog in Canada.</p>

			<h2>German Shepard</h2>	
			<img src="mobileSupport/images/dog3">
				<p>The German Shepherd (German: Deutscher Schäferhund, German pronunciation: [ˈʃɛːfɐˌhʊnt]) is a breed of medium to large-sized working dog that originated in Germany. The breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog in the English language, sometimes abbreviated as GSD and was also formerly known as the Alsatian in Britain. The German Shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899. As part of the Herding Group, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since that time, however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles, and even acting. The German Shepherd is the second-most popular breed of dog in the United States and fourth-most popular in the United Kingdom.</p>

				<h1>Golden Retriever</h1>
			</div>
			<div data-role="content">	
				<h2>Golden Retriever</h2>	
				<img src="mobileSupport/images/dog4">
				<p>The Golden Retriever is a large-sized breed of dog bred as gun dogs to retrieve shot waterfowl such as ducks and upland game birds during hunting and shooting parties, and were named 'retriever' because of their ability to retrieve shot game undamaged. Golden Retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards. They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth in the outdoors, and an outer coat that lies flat against their bodies and repels water. Golden Retrievers are well suited to residency in suburban or country environments. Although they need substantial outdoor exercise, they should be housed in a fenced area because of their instinctual tendency to roam. They shed copiously, particularly at the change of seasons, and require fairly regular grooming.</p>
